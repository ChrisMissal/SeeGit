# SeeGit - The Git Repository Visualizer

This is a little experiment in creating a realtime git repository visualizer.

# Goal
I just want something that I can use during presentations on Git. So as I run commands, it'll show the git graph in a beautiful manner.

# Next steps
* Need to allow you to select a repository to point at. It's currently hard coded.
* I need to add local and remote branch annotations.
