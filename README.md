# SeeGit - The Git Repository Visualizer

This is a little experiment in creating a realtime git repository visualizer.

__WARNING: This is some haacky code. I plan to rewrite it later. It's a proof of concept__

# Goal
I just want something that I can use during presentations on Git. So as I run commands, it'll show the git graph in a beautiful manner.

# Next steps
* Need to allow you to select a repository to point at. It's currently hard coded.
* I need to add local and remote branch annotations.

# Development
If you would like to contribute, I would love to have your contributions! All I ask is try to follow the existing conventions. There's a team ReSharper file with the current conventions.

If you're wondering why the unit tests are structured as they are, read my blog post about [structuring unit tests](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/01/01/structuring-unit-tests.aspx).
